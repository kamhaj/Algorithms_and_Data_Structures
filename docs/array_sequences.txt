''' 
In Python there are 3 types of array sequences:
    
    1. List     []
    2. Tuple    (,)
    3. String   ""

All of them support indexing.

Python is using UNICODE character with 16 bits (2 bytes)
It means that a string "EXAMPLE" would take 2*len(str) = 14 bytes (14*8 bits) in memory


shallow copy -> meaning you're only changing/creating your pointers, not duplicate objects in memory.
hard copy    -> duplicating objects in memory.

In computer science, a dynamic array, growable array, resizable array, dynamic table, mutable array 
or array list is a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added 
or removed. It is supplied with standard libraries in many modern mainstream programming languages.
